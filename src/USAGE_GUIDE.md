### Understanding Fairness Scores

**What are Fairness Scores?**
Fairness scores show how much each roommate contributes to household responsibilities, measured from 0-100.

**How They're Calculated:**
- Completed chores (weighted by effort)
- Meals cooked
- Shared expenses paid

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 **Green (65-100)**: Great contribution
- 🟠 **Orange (55-64)**: Fair contribution
- 🔴 **Red (0-54)**: Low contribution, needs more tasks

**Viewing Scores:**

1. **Quick View (Home Screen)**:
   - See overall household fairness
   - Circular progress indicator
   - Tap "View detailed breakdown" for more

2. **Detailed View (Fairness Tab)**:
   - Sorted from lowest to highest
   - Visual progress bars with color coding
   - Bar chart for easy comparison
   - Lowest scorer highlighted with "Needs more tasks" label

**Pro Tip**: The person with the lowest score should consider taking on the next task!

## 💡 Best Practices

### For a Harmonious Household

1. **Check the app daily**: Stay on top of your tasks
2. **Log meals immediately**: Don't forget to credit the cook
3. **Split purchases fairly**: Use the preview to verify amounts
4. **Complete tasks on time**: Avoid overdue tasks (red alerts)
5. **Balance contributions**: Keep fairness scores roughly equal

### Task Management Tips

- **Set realistic deadlines**: Don't overcommit
- **Estimate effort accurately**: Helps with fair task distribution
- **Communicate delays**: Talk to roommates if you'll be late
- **Reassign if needed**: Life happens, it's okay to adjust

### Financial Transparency

- **Log all shared expenses**: Even small amounts add up
- **Use descriptive names**: "Groceries - Week of Nov 10" is better than just "Groceries"
- **Review regularly**: Check the Activities tab weekly
- **Settle debts promptly**: Use other payment apps (Venmo, PayPal) to actually pay

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: A task shows as overdue but I completed it**
A: Make sure you tapped the checkbox to mark it complete. The system doesn't automatically detect completion.

**Q: The fairness score seems wrong**
A: Scores are calculated from logged activities only. Make sure all tasks, meals, and purchases are recorded.

**Q: How do I delete an activity?**
A: Currently, activities can only be marked complete, not deleted. This maintains an accurate history.

**Q: Can I edit an activity after adding it?**
A: The current version doesn't support editing. Double-check details before saving.

**Q: The splitting preview doesn't show my custom amounts**
A: Currently, live preview only works for "Split Equally" method. Percentage and Custom modes are coming soon.

## 📊 Sample Workflow

## 🎓 Advanced Tips

### Optimizing Task Distribution

- **High-effort tasks** (45+ min): Rotate among all roommates
- **Low-effort tasks** (5-15 min): Can be assigned to lowest scorer
- **Urgent tasks**: Assign to whoever's available, regardless of score

### Meal Planning

- **Coordinate schedules**: Log who's eating to plan portions
- **Credit partial cooking**: If multiple people help, primary chef gets credit
- **Leftovers count**: If you reheated and served, log it

### Expense Management

- **Shared vs. Personal**: Only log truly shared expenses
- **Recurring bills**: Log monthly (Internet, utilities)
- **Bulk purchases**: Use "Split Equally" for household items
- **Unequal usage**: Use "Split by Percentage" for items like milk, if one person uses 60%
